# ML-Simple-Linear-Regression-Students_score-data

 **Objective:** 

>To understand and implement simple linear regression using the student_scores.csv dataset, predicting student scores based on the number of study hours.

>Load the dataset and display the first few rows.

>Plot a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the number of hours studied and the scores obtained.

>Select the feature (hours studied) and target variable (scores obtained).Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

>Create and train a simple linear regression model using the training data.

>Use the trained model to predict the scores on the test data.

>Plot the regression line on the scatter plot of the test data to visualize the fit.

>Highlight the predicted vs. actual scores on the plot.
